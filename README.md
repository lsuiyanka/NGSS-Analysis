The National Geographic Smell Survey (NGSS) was a joint effort undertaken by National Geographic Magazine and The Monell Chemical Senses Center to survey individuals on their smell response to 6 individual substances. Over 11 million surveys were distributed in 1986, of which >1 million responses were catalogued.

In this analysis we merge data from the NGSS with publicly available air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency database. We are interested in the exploring the effect commonly occuring air pollutants, such as particulate matter, has on semll response.
